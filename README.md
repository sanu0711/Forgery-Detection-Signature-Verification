# Forgery-Detection-Signature-Verification
This project aims to develop a signature verification system using transfer learning techniques in deep learning. The system utilizes a pre-trained convolutional neural network (CNN) model, ResNet50, and fine-tunes it on a dataset of signatures to achieve user-independent verification.
