This project is a **Signature Forgery Detection System** built using **Django** and **TensorFlow/Keras**, which leverages **transfer learning** with pre-trained CNN models including **ResNet50**, **VGG16**, **VGG19**, and a **custom CNN model**. The aim is to classify whether a given signature is *genuine* or *forged*.

## ðŸ“Œ Project Objectives

- Detect forged signatures using deep learning
- Use transfer learning with pre-trained models for efficient training
- Train multiple models for comparison and accuracy benchmarking
- Serve predictions through a Django web interface (optional for deployment)

## ðŸ§  Model Architectures

### 1. ðŸ”§ Custom CNN Model

A standard CNN with multiple convolution and pooling layers followed by dense layers.

- Input size: `150x150`
- Layers: Conv2D â†’ MaxPooling â†’ Dense
- Optimizer: Adam (`lr=0.0001`)
- Loss: Binary Crossentropy
- Metrics: Accuracy
- Epochs: `100` (with early stopping)

---

### 2. ðŸ§  ResNet50 (Transfer Learning)

- Pre-trained on ImageNet (`include_top=False`)
- Input size: `64x64`
- Pooling: `avg`
- Added Layers: Flatten â†’ Dense(512 â†’ 435 â†’ 365 â†’ 1)
- Trainable Layers: All frozen
- Optimizer: Adam
- Epochs: `100` (early stopping with patience 30)

---

### 3. ðŸ§  VGG16 (Transfer Learning)

- Pre-trained on ImageNet (`include_top=False`)
- Input size: `64x64`
- Pooling: `avg`
- Added Layers: Flatten â†’ Dense(512 â†’ 450 â†’ 260 â†’ 1)
- Trainable Layers: All frozen
- Optimizer: Adam
- Epochs: `100` (early stopping with patience 30)

### 4. ðŸ§  VGG19 (Transfer Learning)

- Pre-trained on ImageNet (`include_top=False`)
- Input size: `64x64`
- Pooling: `avg`
- Added Layers: Flatten â†’ Dense(512 â†’ 455 â†’ 250 â†’ 1)
- Trainable Layers: All frozen
- Optimizer: Adam
- Epochs: `100` (early stopping with patience 30)
